# Public demo of Run4more analytics data.

This repo contains a sample of data produced by the Run4more App and a sample of the analytic tools that are being used.  
The motivation for this repo was to provide to the students of the https://bis-analytics.econ.uoa.gr/ Postgraduate Program real life data and problem sets.
Following all the basic steps to learning python, this repo is used to provide real-use cases for everything.  
The goal is to show a practical use of everything that is being taught and build the foundations for understanding multi-index dataframes while learning indexing and slicing on simple data strucutures such as lists and strings.  

The repo follows the material of the University e-class (private to enrolled students) and relates it to a real use-case of a StartUp Company.

After receiving useful students' feedback from past years it is being refactored to become public and to meet several purposes. It is meant to achieve the following:   
1. Be used as educational material for students interested in learning python and train on real data and problem sets.  
2. Demonstrate to Run4more App users how their App data help our mission to increase physical activity.  
3. Demonstrate to Run4more App partners the data that we collect and analyze.  
4. Create a working example for the "Run4more StartUps Academy" project, a project in progress in which StartUps offer a sample of their data to help Universities provide more efficient education and research.  

The App data are produced in real time by "events" and "actions" while using the App.
They are stored in a mongoDB database.   
For the purposes of this repo, a sample of data is stored in various formats.
This data will be processed and presented using various tools and visualization libraries.

The data being used are of various categories, text, numeric, categorical, quantitative, date, time, geolocation, binary, multi-class.
Tasks begin with simple python tasks such as working with strings and basic data containers, such as to fix email lists.
Tasks gradually advance to include working on the data with advanced ML algorithms and visualisation tools.

At the end of studying the material, students should be able to:  
* manage and preprocess data of various types,
* implement ML algorithms,
* create numerical, categorical, geospatial charts,
* deploy online and interactive visualization dashboards that can be used in production.

**This repo is by design a blend of what should in principle be two distinct repositories, which have been merged together to provide a more comprehensive learning experience.**
It consists of two general purpose parts:  

Part A) The introductory teaching material which contains all sections that follow the material of the course.  
The introductory material makes use of the Run4more data to provide real life examples of the tasks being taught.  

Part B) The Run4more gallery which contains advanced coding topics, beyond what is taught in course.

## Part A) Introductory teaching material.
Each section is accompanied by jupyter notebooks and a .py files that contain the code and the explanation of the tasks.  

### Section 1: Basic python for Everything
See lecture files 1-5 of the e-class.  
The goal of this section is to learn the basics of python and how this can be useful when dealing with Data.

### Section 2: Working with Data and Dataframes
See lecture 6 files of the e-class.

### Section 3: Static and Interactive Visualisations
See lecture 7 files of the e-class.  

### Section 4: Machine Learning
See lectures 8-12 files of the e-class.

### Section 5: Deep Learning and AI

### Section 6: Databases

### Section 7: Big Data storage and analysis

## Part B) Run4more gallery.
