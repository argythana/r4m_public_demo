    "----------------\n",
    "INSTRUCTIONS TO:\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Create a [Virtual Environment](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments) for project reproducability, resolve conflicting dependencies, mainting purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Install [modules in it](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html) (only in it) or [install packages in it.](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#id13)   \n",
    "Can you tell the difference between modules and packages? Read the top two answers [here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7948494/whats-the-difference-between-a-python-module-and-a-python-package)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: install packages and modules ONLY from trusted sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Run a jupyter notebook from your PC.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Make sure Python is included in Windows PATH (when installing).  \n",
    "Else: modify the installation from control panel (add or remove programs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1a. Open \"Console\", aka \"Command Line Interface\" (CLI), aka \"Terminal, aka \"Shell\".  \n",
    "I will refer to it as **CLI**.    \n",
    "    For Windows:  \n",
    "\ta) press \"Windows key\" + \"R\"  \n",
    "\tb) type the word \"cmd\", press Enter\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now be inside the **Operating System** terminal in **your user** default path:  \n",
    "```C:\\Users\\thanasis_argyriou>```\n",
    "\n",
    "\"thanasis_argyriou\" is me, not you!\n",
    "\t\n",
    "For [Mac OS CLI usage check here.](https://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/getting_started.html#what-is-python-exactly)\n",
    "\n",
    "*For ALL the following commands, if python CLI command does not work in Windows shell:\t \n",
    "replace \"python\" with \"py\" (py is the Windows Python launcher).* \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1b. Check python and pip version.  \n",
    "Inside the CLI, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python --version```  (output should be like: 3.9.1)  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python -m pip --version```   (Check pip version and if pip is installed)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the version number and the location (aka path) where the pip package is located by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Make sure you are at your Window command line, which has a single > (or the \\$ sign in MacOS) at the end,\n",
    "not at python’s command prompt (python command line has three >>> instead)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Make a new directory, (aka folder) using ```mkdir``` (make directory) command.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Name the new directory as: ```uoa_py_course```    \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the CLI, type:  \n",
    "```C:\\Users\\thanasis_argyriou>mkdir uoa_py_course```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Go inside that new directory using ```cd``` (change directory) command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```cd uoa_py_course```\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt output would be:  \n",
    "```C:\\Users\\tharg\\uoa_py_course>```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Create a new virtual environment with ```venv``` python package.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The environment should be made inside the ```uoa_py_course``` folder.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the environment will be: ```course_venv```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the enviroment, be inside the CLI and type:  \n",
    "```C:\\Users\\tharg\\uoa_py_course>python -m venv course_venv```  \n",
    "\n",
    "You just created a virtual environment named: ```course_venv```.   \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to inspect what is inside use:   ```cd course_venv```  and then ```dir``` command, or just ```dir course_venv```,\n",
    "or in MacOS ```ls course_venv```.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Activate virtual environment,   \n",
    "\n",
    "Being **above** of the directory ```course_venv``` type in the CLI:    \n",
    "```.\\course_venv\\Scripts\\activate```    \n",
    "\n",
    "or ```course_venv\\Scripts\\activate```\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete command in the CLI will look like:  \n",
    "```C:\\Users\\USER_YOU_NOT_ME\\uoa_py_course>.\\course_venv\\Scripts\\activate``` \n",
    "    \n",
    "If done correctly, you will see a parenthesis in front of directory path:  \n",
    "```(course_venv) C:\\Users\\USER_YOU_NOT_ME\\uoa_py_course```\n",
    "\n",
    "To deactivate use:  \n",
    "```deactivate```\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate the virtual environment in **MacOS** type:  \n",
    "```myusername$ source ./course_venv/bin/activate```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Install python packages.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The virtual environment should be activated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the [pip package](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/) \n",

    "> pip is the package installer for Python. You can use pip to install packages from the Python Package Index and other indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6a. Upgrade to latest version of pip, in CLI, type:  \n",
    "```python -m pip install --upgrade pip```  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6b. Install and upgrade setuptools and wheel (install if not installed).  \n",
    "```python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel```  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> The general syntax to install any package is:  \n",
    "```python -m pip install <package_name>``` \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6c. Install a single package (e.g. numpy).\n",
    "```python -m pip install numpy```  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6d. Install many packages at once. Make sure to install jupyterlab\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> You may install more than one packages at once:  \n",
    "```python -m pip install <package_a> <package_b> <package_x> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python -m pip install pandas jupyterlab seaborn```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Inspect and manage installed packages using pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7a. Show packages installed by pip in the virtual environment:\n",
    "```pip freeze```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7b. Show any single package version, dependecies, required by:  \n",
    "```pip show <package name>```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the version number and the location (aka path) where the package is located in the virtual environment.  \n",
    "Notice that this is different than the default python installation path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7c. Save all packages installed by pip to new \".txt\" file:\n",
    "```pip freeze > requirements.txt```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't try the following (yet) or try at your onw risk.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To delete a virtual environment, delete the whole folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "To uninstall a module, type:  \n",
    "```python -m pip uninstall <package_name>```\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\n",
    "To install many packages at once from a file (recursively):   \n",

    "## 8. Run a jupyter lab interactive notebook in your PC:\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyterlab is an **interactive** feature rich editor that uses your browser. Read about it [here](https://jupyter.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you installed the packages in a virtual environment,   \n",
    "the environment **should be activated** to run them.  \n",
    "So, **activate** the venv **everytime** before running the jupyter-lab notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Windows CLI type:  \n",
    "```jupyter lab``` or ```jupyter-lab```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Be careful:   \n",
    "> When **installing** jupyterlab, there should be **no space** in between. It is **one word**.  \n",
    "> When **running** jupyter lab, there should be **blank space** between the **two words**, or a dash inbetween **jupyter-lab**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put any **interactive python notebook type** files (```.ipynb```) in the proper folder.  \n",
    "It is recommended to make separate folders, **next to** the **course_venv** folder. E.g.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Make a directory called **data** to store data files.  \n",
    "> Make a directory called **notebooks** to store notebooks.  \n",
    "> Make a directory called **playground** to store draft notebooks and whatever files.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may make directories either from the CLI or by using the file explorer graphical Interface.  \n",
    "The result is the same. \n",

    "The **course_venv** directory should NOT be touched, unless you know what you are doing.\n",
    "This directory is reserved for python packages and virtual environment management and configuration.  \n",
