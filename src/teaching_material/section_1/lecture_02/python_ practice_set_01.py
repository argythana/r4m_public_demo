## Practice Exercises set 1: Solve the following exercises in the same file.
## After reading all 2nd lecture material, solve the first 6 exercises.

Hints for debugging (= finding errors):
test with small numbers,
use whitespaces, descriptive names, blank lines \n,
comment-out the line that breaks your code to test what works or not.

# Exercise 01: Find the square of a positive integer number
'''
Ask user for a positive integer number, find its square and print it.
Remember to convert to correct data type.
Use type() to test data types and print the test output.
'''


# exercise 2: Find average speed
'''
A car travels 976.5 Kms in 630 minutes.
a) How many hours did it travel? Find it and print it.
b) Find the average speed per hour and print it.
'''


## Exercise 3: Dollars to Euros Converter
'''
Ask user for the $/€ exchange rate and the amount of dollars she wants to convert to euros.
Find the euro equivalent and print it.
'''


## Exercise 4: Find total capital after n periods
'''
Ask user for the initial amount of capital she wants to deposit.

total_C = k * ((1 + (r/t)) ** (t*y)

where:
    total_C = total capital,
    k = principal amount (initial deposit),
    r = interest rate,
    t = compounding periods per year

Interest is compounded twice a year (t = 2)
(Compound interest means that the interest you earn is added to your principal)

Interest rate is 2.1% (r = 0.021).

Find:
a) the total capital the user will have after 10 years (y = 10).
b) the return to capital as a percentage of initial deposit.
c) Print both results in a single call of print() in a small text where you mention all other variables at play.

Hint: for deposit of 100, the total Capital after 10 years is 123.23281155765122

# Exercise 05: Find the Area of a circle for RADIUS = 3.
'''
-> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_circle
Hint: use math.pi
'''

# Exercise 06: Ask for the sides of an orthogonal triangle,
# calculate the hypotenuse and print it.

#=== FOR FUTURE LECTURES ===================

# Exercise 07: Find the maximum, minimum and max-min range of
the following sample of numbers:
# sample = [170, 155, 165, 185, 180, 160, 175, 170, 170]
'''Hint: Do Not Repeat Yourself.'''


# Exercise 08: Find the mean, variance and standard deviation of the sample above
'''
Hint: import statistics module and use help(statistics) to find the methods.
Use help(module.method) (substitute the respective names)
'''


# Exercise 09: Find the square root of log(10) and the square of log(e)
'''Hint: use math.log'''


# Exercise 10: Find the value of the standard logistic function.
'''
-> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function
for x = 2 (k = 1, x0 = 0 and L = 1)
Hint: use math.e
'''


# Exercise 11: Swap two variables values.
'''
Define two variables: A = 4 and B = 25.
Then replace each other's value (swap values) such that:
print(A, B) returns 25, 4.
Do this without explixitly using numbers again.
Hint: there are more than one solutions,
e.g. use an extra variable, use math operations, ...
